    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object which contains information about the type of exception and the location where it occurred in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as invalid input data, incorrect use of functions or objects, or unexpected system behavior. Some common types of exceptions in Python include NameError, TypeError, ValueError, and ZeroDivisionError."

    "The main difference between an exception and a syntax error is that an exception occurs during the execution of a program, while a syntax error occurs before the program is executed. In other words, a syntax error is a mistake in the code that prevents the program from being run, while an exception is a problem that occurs during the program's execution that causes it to terminate or behave unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that syntax errors are generally easier to detect and fix than exceptions since they usually result in a clear error message pointing to the location of the error in the code. Exceptions, on the other hand, can be more difficult to diagnose and fix since they can occur at any point during the program's execution and may be caused by a variety of factors."
