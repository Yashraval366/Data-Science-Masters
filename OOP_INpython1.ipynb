    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the internal details and implementation of an object from the outside world, and instead providing a public interface through which other objects can interact with it. This helps to protect the object's state and behavior from unauthorized access or modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of identifying the essential features or properties of an object, while ignoring the non-essential details. This helps to simplify complex systems by focusing on the most important aspects and hiding unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability of a subclass to inherit the properties and methods of its parent class. This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchies of related classes, and enables objects to be organized into more general and specific categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message or method call in different ways. This allows for more flexible and extensible code, and enables objects to be used interchangeably in different contexts.\n"
